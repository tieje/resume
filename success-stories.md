For a SharePoint intranet site, our non-technical stake holders loved the the social media webpart in the demo site and requested it in the site mockup. In the time that it took for the site mockup to be approved, the social media webpart, was no longer offered by our partner. I communicated the unfortunate news to the client while offering ready-made alternative webparts from a different business partner for review. Despite, our client's initial hesitation, they loved the simplicity offered by the new webparts so much that they did not mind paying the additional annual fees associated with the new webparts.
