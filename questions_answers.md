Hi Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out!

In your experience, what has been the most challenging technical problem you've solved in your career, and how did you approach it?

I needed to use Docker Swarm to run a web app on multiple Raspberry Pis (RPI). Because Docker does not support the RPI architecture out of the box, I needed to transfer the web app to the RPIs then install Docker on the RPI and create a custom image of the web app, and finally push the image to Docker hub. Easier said than done. This painful experience motivated me to learn about AWS and now I am an AWS Certified Developer - Associate.

Could you share an instance where your strong work ethic significantly contributed to a project's success or helped overcome a major technical challenge?

In my previous job, I needed to provide quick turnover for frontend SharePoint intranet sites for multiple clients simultaneously. What we could show to clients was purely limited to how much I could get done in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I was the bottleneck. It was due to my zealousness and expertise that we were able to consistently meet deadlines and under-promise and over-deliver to our clients.

Is there a particular coding project you've worked on that you felt particularly passionate about? What made it special for you?

rs_sec_edgar: The first public library that I've ever released. It is a small library for querying the Security Exchange Commission's EDGAR API, written in Rust. Originally built to serve my own stock trading bot, this is the first time I built a complete project, end-to-end with testing and documentation, intended to be used by everyone. As a web developer, you rarely ever "complete" a project. Everything is always in maintenance. Because Rust has guaranteed backwards compatibility, I have confidence that this library will work for as long as the SEC's EDGAR exists.

What is the most ambitious technical goal you've set in your professional career, and how are you working towards achieving it?

Fix American Healthcare through a new healthcare platform based on AI. I used to work for a company that built and sold an American Healthcare platform. It was sturdy and secure, but slow and inflexible. Despite these shortcomings, the company was successful because we had excellent business relations managers. For this reason (and because we massively overpay for healthcare compared to other developed nations), I believe the industry is long overdue for innovation. If I were to build a better platform, it would be in Rust for its speed and safety features. So I've been studying a lot of Rust lately. It's much more difficult than I bargained for so I haven't gotten to learning the AI part yet.
