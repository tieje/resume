Dear HR at Deloitte,

&nbsp;

I am interested in the opening for Full Stack Developer at Deloitte.

I'm drawn to this role because of the potential career advancement that Deloitte provides.

I am a full stack web developer with five years of programming experience. Alongside a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Holberton (a rigorous 18-month coding bootcamp), I have a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Connecticut, where I attended with honors on full scholarship and earned the prestigious Roland Award for an outstanding senior thesis.

My most recent employment was as a full stack developer for Synergy Corporate Technologies, where I learned the basics of software consultancy through direct communication with clients. There I became familiar with the Microsoft tech stack, which included technologies such as Azure, SharePoint, and PowerShell. While building Microsoft apps for clients, my full stack skills were put to use in building the frontend of their proprietary ticketing from scratch with React and Redux. My manager regularly praised me for my hard work, diligence, and technical achievements.

I am excited to apply my education, skills, and work ethic to your fine organization.

Please let me know a convenient time to discuss this possibility.

Thank you very much.

&nbsp;

Sincerely,

Thomas Francis
